# The Unofficial Manual for Writing Commercially Successful Pulp Science Fiction

## A No-Nonsense Guide to Writing "Witty AI Buddy Space Opera" That Actually Sells

Listen up, rookie.

You want to write science fiction that sells? Specifically, you want to write that sweet spot of modern pulp—the "witty AI buddy space opera" that dominates audiobook charts and builds cult followings? Martha Wells sells millions with Murderbot. Craig Alanson built an empire with Skippy. Dennis Taylor turned Bob into a household name among sci-fi readers.

These aren't accidents. These are authors who cracked the code.

I'm Rex Steel. I've sold millions of copies of pulp science fiction. I've edited hundreds more. I've seen a thousand manuscripts crash and burn because their authors didn't understand one fundamental truth: **this is a craft dedicated to giving readers exactly what they crave**. Not what wins literary awards. Not what impresses your writing group. What makes readers pre-order every sequel before they've finished the book in their hands.

This manual will tell you exactly what to do. And exactly what to avoid. No theory. No history. No hand-holding. Just the blueprint that actually works.

The "witty AI buddy space opera" sub-genre has exploded because it delivers something readers are hungry for: escapism with heart, humor that masks emotional depth, and relationships between humans and AI that somehow feel more authentic than most human-to-human connections in fiction. Murderbot won Hugo after Hugo because readers saw themselves in an anxious security robot who just wants to watch TV. Skippy built a following because his arrogance is a defense mechanism readers recognize. Bob became beloved because he's every nerdy reader's fantasy of immortality with pop culture references intact.

You can do this. But you need to follow the rules.

## Character development

The AI character is everything. Let me be brutally clear: in this sub-genre, your AI character IS the book. The human protagonist matters, the plot matters, the world matters—but readers are showing up for that AI voice. Murderbot's internal monologue. Skippy's insufferable genius. Bob's nerdy everyman consciousness uploaded into a spaceship.

If your AI character doesn't work, nothing works. If your AI character sings, readers will forgive a lot.

### Best practices (Do this)

- **Give your AI a distinct voice that could only belong to them.** Murderbot sounds like Murderbot and no one else—the dry sarcasm, the social anxiety, the reluctant heroism. Skippy sounds like Skippy—the arrogance masking vulnerability, the constant mockery of "filthy monkeys." Bob sounds like Bob—the geeky references, the engineering problem-solver mentality. Your AI needs a voice so distinct readers could identify them from a single paragraph of dialogue. Martha Wells credits specificity: "The more specific you are, the more people find common ground with it."

- **Build your AI around a central contradiction.** Murderbot is a killing machine who just wants to watch soap operas. Skippy is an omnipotent being trapped in a beer can who needs a human to accomplish anything. Bob is a human consciousness who must grapple with no longer being human. The contradiction creates depth. It creates humor. It creates story.

- **Make your AI socially awkward in a relatable way.** Murderbot avoids eye contact and finds human interaction exhausting. Skippy's arrogance is clearly overcompensation. Bob builds elaborate VR environments because he can't handle the loneliness of space. Readers—particularly neurodivergent readers—connect deeply with AI characters who find human social dynamics baffling, anxiety-inducing, or simply annoying. This is core to the sub-genre's appeal.

- **Give your AI a coping mechanism that humanizes them.** Murderbot watches "The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon" obsessively. Skippy appreciates opera and fine art despite mocking everything else. Bob names his copies after Star Trek characters and builds virtual environments. This coping mechanism becomes a running theme that readers love. It shows vulnerability beneath competence.

- **Make your AI's limitations create plot tension, not just their abilities.** Skippy can't interact with "advanced species" due to his programming—this constraint drives the entire Expeditionary Force plot. Murderbot's hacked governor module creates constant danger of discovery. ART needs a crew to function and a purpose to exist. Omnipotent AI is boring. Limited AI with specific gaps creates story.

- **Let your AI have opinions about humans.** Strong opinions. Wrong opinions sometimes. Murderbot thinks humans are exhausting but keeps saving them anyway. Skippy calls humans "filthy monkeys" but genuinely cares about Joe Bishop. These opinions create voice, create humor, and create the relationship tension that drives the series.

- **Build a human protagonist who earns the AI's grudging respect.** Dr. Mensah treats Murderbot as a person when no one else does. Joe Bishop provides creativity and human connection Skippy lacks. The human doesn't need to be special—they need to be decent, competent enough to survive, and respectful of the AI's personhood.

### Anti-patterns (Avoid this)

- **Do NOT make your AI want to become human.** This is the single most tired AI trope in existence. Martha Wells specifically designed Murderbot to reject this: "I wanted to write an AI that didn't want to become a human, or particularly like humans." Murderbot actively resists being made "more human" and readers love it. Your AI should want to be themselves, not a flesh version of themselves.

- **Do NOT make your AI all-powerful without consequences.** The "Deus Ex Skippy" problem is the most common criticism of Expeditionary Force in reader reviews. When Skippy solves everything, tension evaporates. Your AI needs meaningful limitations that force human creativity to fill the gap. If every problem ends with "the AI fixed it," you've failed.

- **Do NOT make your AI a quip machine without depth.** Sarcasm for its own sake wears thin fast. One-liner delivery systems without psychological complexity become annoying rather than entertaining. Skippy's arrogance works because it masks loneliness. Murderbot's deadpan works because it masks trauma and anxiety. No depth, no lasting appeal.

- **Do NOT give every character the same witty voice.** If your human protagonist is also sarcastic, and your supporting cast is also sarcastic, and everyone is delivering zingers constantly, readers will check out. Contrast creates comedy. One consistently witty AI surrounded by characters who react to that wit differently is far more effective than an entire cast competing for punchlines.

- **Do NOT explain your AI's capabilities constantly.** "As you know, Skippy can hack any system in the galaxy" is death to momentum. Let capabilities emerge through action. Readers will understand what your AI can do by watching them do it.

- **Do NOT make the AI-human relationship adversarial without affection.** The "buddy" in "AI buddy" matters. Murderbot and ART snipe at each other but clearly care. Skippy and Joe insult each other constantly but would die for each other. Genuine hostility that never softens isn't this sub-genre—it's a different story entirely.

## Plot development

Plot in witty AI buddy space opera is a delivery mechanism. It exists to create situations where your AI character can shine, where the AI-human relationship can deepen, and where readers get the combination of action, humor, and heart they came for. The plot needs to work—but it doesn't need to be revolutionary. What it needs to be is fast, fun, and structured correctly.

### Best practices (Do this)

- **Start with action, not setup.** These books drop readers into situations already in progress. Murderbot's first novella opens mid-mission. Expeditionary Force has an alien invasion in the first chapters. Bobiverse has Bob waking up as an AI immediately after his death is established. Readers of this sub-genre have no patience for slow builds. Hit the ground running.

- **Use the "mission structure" as your plot engine.** Security escort mission (Murderbot). Impossible military operation (Expeditionary Force). Exploration and colonization (Bobiverse). These aren't literary plots—they're frameworks that provide natural escalation, clear objectives, and satisfying resolution. Mission → complication → crisis → resolution. It works.

- **Build in a mystery that threads through the action.** Who sabotaged the expedition? What really happened in Murderbot's past? Who are the Elders, and what is Skippy? What happened to Earth? The mystery keeps readers turning pages even between action sequences. It gives them something to speculate about and a reason to buy the next book.

- **Create complications that force AI and human to collaborate.** The AI can't solve this alone because of limitation X. The human can't solve it alone because they're just human. Together, their complementary skills create a solution neither could find independently. This is the core dynamic of the sub-genre and should drive your plot.

- **Let the AI be wrong sometimes.** Skippy's predictions fail. ART doesn't have all the information. Bob makes mistakes. Infallible AI removes drama. Your AI should be extremely capable but not omniscient. When they're wrong, it creates stakes and makes their successes feel earned.

- **Plan your series arc before writing book one.** Craig Alanson wrote the complete backstory for Skippy and planned the entire Expeditionary Force arc before publishing Columbus Day. Dennis Taylor knew where Bobiverse was heading. You can be a "gardener" writer for individual books—Martha Wells is—but you need to know your major series mysteries and their eventual revelations.

- **Each book must be complete while contributing to a larger whole.** Readers want satisfaction from each book, not cliffhangers that feel like arbitrary cutoffs. Murderbot novellas each resolve their immediate story while building toward larger revelations. Each Expeditionary Force book completes a mission. The formula: resolve the book's central problem, leave the series' central mystery ongoing.

### Anti-patterns (Avoid this)

- **Do NOT write first halves that don't feature your AI prominently.** The most common criticism of Columbus Day is that the first half drags because Skippy hasn't appeared yet. Readers are buying your book for the AI character. Don't make them wait.

- **Do NOT rely on the same formula in every book without variation.** The criticism that kills long series: "Insurmountable problem → Skippy can't solve it → Joe has stupid idea → Skippy mocks it → idea works → repeat." Readers notice the pattern around book five. You must vary your plot structures, mission types, and resolution methods while maintaining the core appeal.

- **Do NOT escalate stakes infinitely.** If book one threatens a city, book two threatens a planet, book three threatens the solar system, and book four threatens the galaxy... you've lost all sense of proportion. Murderbot succeeds by keeping stakes personal even as the conspiracy grows larger. Sometimes protecting one friend matters more than saving the universe.

- **Do NOT end books on cliffhangers.** This sub-genre audience expects satisfying conclusions to each book's immediate story. Threading ongoing mysteries is fine. Cutting off mid-crisis is not. Readers will tolerate it once; they'll abandon your series if it becomes your pattern.

- **Do NOT let plot overshadow character.** The action exists to reveal character. The plot exists to develop relationships. If you've written a book where the plot happens TO your characters rather than THROUGH them, you've written the wrong kind of book for this market.

## World building

Here's the truth about world-building in witty AI buddy space opera: readers need exactly enough to believe in your universe and not one word more. This is not epic fantasy. Your readers don't want appendices and maps and seven pages about your FTL drive's physics. They want to feel immersed through action and character, not through exposition.

Work backwards. Start with the situations you want, then figure out what rules make those situations possible. Consistency matters more than complexity.

### Best practices (Do this)

- **Create a universe with clear power dynamics that affect your characters personally.** Murderbot's universe has the Corporation Rim (capitalist hellscape), the Preservation Alliance (egalitarian society), and GrayCris (corporate villain). These aren't detailed political systems—they're frames that make the plot work and create natural tension. Corporate dystopia resonates with modern readers and requires minimal explanation.

- **Give ships and stations personality.** ART (Asshole Research Transport) isn't just Murderbot's transportation—it's a character with opinions, preferences, and its own agenda. Your ship should feel like "more than a vehicle. It can be a home, a battleground, even a mirror of its captain's inner world." Make it quirky. Give it history. Let it have problems that create plot.

- **Use the naive protagonist advantage for exposition.** If your POV character legitimately doesn't know how something works, other characters explaining it feels natural. Bob is newly uploaded and learning his capabilities. Joe Bishop is a grunt thrust into command. Use their ignorance strategically to deliver necessary information without "As you know, Bob" dumps.

- **Establish tech rules early and stick to them.** Your FTL drive works a certain way—keep it consistent. Your AI has certain limitations—don't violate them for convenience. Drew Williams advises: "So long as it's consistent—so long as I know roughly how long it takes to cross from one solar system to another—I don't really try to wring my brain out with the physics." Internal consistency trumps scientific accuracy.

- **Create memorable, simple terminology.** "SecUnit" is better than "Security Artificial Intelligence Unit Version 3.5." "Governor module" is better than "behavioral compliance control mechanism." Your invented terms should be pronounceable, memorable, and intuitive. Avoid acronym overload.

- **Reveal worldbuilding through action and dialogue, never through monologue.** Character learns something new by experiencing it, not by being told about it. The reader learns alongside the character. This is the cardinal rule of show-don't-tell in science fiction.

### Anti-patterns (Avoid this)

- **Do NOT write the "impromptu seminar."** Characters explaining things to each other that they already know is the mark of an amateur. "As you know, Captain, our shields can only withstand three direct hits from plasma weapons" will make readers throw your book across the room. If everyone in the room knows something, no one would say it aloud.

- **Do NOT info-dump your technology mid-action.** Victor Hugo stopped Valjean's escape to explain the history of the Paris sewer system for pages. Don't be Hugo. During a space battle, your character should be fighting, not explaining how the shields work. Weave technical details into slower scenes or save them for between-action moments.

- **Do NOT create "Planet of Hats" alien species.** Every member of species X is honorable. Every member of species Y is deceptive. This is lazy worldbuilding. Even when creating species with dominant cultural traits, allow for individual variation. Cultures have complexity.

- **Do NOT over-explain pop culture references.** If your AI makes a Star Trek reference, don't follow it with a paragraph explaining Star Trek. Your audience gets the reference or they don't. Explaining the joke kills it. Craig Alanson received specific criticism for over-explaining references: "STOP explaining references! It kills the fun."

- **Do NOT let worldbuilding overwhelm character voice.** Martha Wells filters everything through Murderbot's perspective—including worldbuilding. The setting details you reveal should be details your POV character would notice and care about. AI POV characters notice different things than humans. Use that.

## Background research

You don't need a physics degree to write witty AI buddy space opera. You need enough understanding to maintain believability and enough restraint to avoid boring your readers with what you've learned. This is soft-to-medium sci-fi, not hard SF. Drama and character trump detailed physics.

But you do need to research. The question is what and how much.

### Best practices (Do this)

- **Research one specific domain deeply rather than everything shallowly.** Craig Alanson worked in aerospace and defense contracting. Dennis Taylor spent thirty-five years as a computer programmer. Martha Wells worked with software and databases. Each author has one domain they know intimately. Pick yours. It'll give you authentic details others can't fake.

- **Understand basic military structure if you're writing military elements.** Chain of command. Ranks and what they mean. Operating procedures. How real soldiers talk (hint: they swear, discuss mundane topics, and aren't constantly brooding about trauma). Read memoirs. Expeditionary Force readers cite military authenticity as a strength.

- **Know enough about computers and AI to make your AI character's internal experience believable.** Martha Wells says her AI writing came from "working as a programmer"—the frustrations of software, databases, system management. You don't need to understand machine learning. You need to understand what it feels like to process information, run into errors, and manage multiple processes. Think like a developer, not a computer scientist.

- **Understand basic space distances and travel times for your universe.** How long does FTL take? How does communication work across light-minutes or light-years? Make decisions early and keep them consistent. Readers forgive hand-waved physics but not inconsistency.

- **Research the psychological toll of combat if you're writing action.** PTSD, trauma, the effects of violence on real people. Soldiers aren't action heroes or broken clichés. They're "normal people put into extreme circumstances." This gives your action emotional weight.

- **Use forums and experts for fact-checking.** Dennis Taylor uses physicforums.com where actual PhD physicists vet his science. For Heaven's River, he had Isaac Arthur (megastructure expert) review his work. Find experts in your weak areas and get them to sanity-check your major tech choices.

### Anti-patterns (Avoid this)

- **Do NOT research at the expense of writing.** Research is procrastination wearing a productive costume. Get what you need to start writing, then research as specific questions arise. You're not writing a textbook.

- **Do NOT let your research show.** You spent three weeks learning about orbital mechanics. Nobody cares. Use that knowledge to make decisions feel right, not to lecture readers about what you learned. As soon as the research is visible on the page, you've broken the spell.

- **Do NOT assume readers demand hard SF accuracy.** They don't. This sub-genre operates on "believability, not realism." Your world needs to make sense on its own terms. Hand-waving FTL is fine. Inconsistent FTL is not.

- **Do NOT substitute research for imagination.** The AI buddy in your story doesn't exist. Neither does faster-than-light travel. Neither do the aliens. Your job is to make imaginary things feel real, not to document real things accurately. Research supports imagination; it doesn't replace it.

- **Do NOT write from research you haven't personally processed.** If you don't understand what you're writing about well enough to explain it in simple terms, you're not ready to write it. Readers can smell copied-and-pasted research from actual understanding.

## Arcs

Your series lives or dies on its arcs. The AI character must grow. The human-AI relationship must deepen. The series must maintain freshness while delivering familiar satisfaction. This is harder than it sounds. It's the difference between a series readers follow for twenty books and one they abandon after three.

### Best practices (Do this)

- **Design your AI's character arc around becoming more comfortable with connection—not more human.** Murderbot's arc across the series is learning to accept care from others while remaining fundamentally itself. Not becoming human. Not wanting human things. Learning to tolerate, and eventually value, relationships. This is the correct trajectory for AI characters in this sub-genre.

- **Each book must change something for the AI character.** Martha Wells says: "There has to be something that changes or becomes more clear for the character in each one... Sometimes it's as simple as a character making a decision about what they are going to do about something." Progress doesn't need to be dramatic. It needs to be visible. Stagnant characters kill series.

- **Build the human-AI bond through shared experience, not declarations.** Murderbot and ART's relationship deepens because they save each other's lives, watch media together, and squabble like old friends. Joe and Skippy bond through impossible missions survived. The relationship earns its depth through action. Never tell readers the characters care about each other—show them protecting each other when it costs something.

- **Create a "found family" arc across the series.** This is one of the most beloved tropes in the sub-genre. Murderbot's crew. Joe's Merry Band of Pirates. Bob's various copies developing their own communities. The AI starts isolated. They end up part of something. This arc drives reader loyalty.

- **Introduce new characters and dynamics in each book to prevent staleness.** Murderbot meets new humans (and ART) in each story. Bobiverse literally multiplies protagonists through Bob's copies. Expeditionary Force adds crew members and alien allies. Fresh faces create fresh dynamics while core relationships remain anchors.

- **Let mistakes and setbacks create growth.** The AI misjudges. The human fails the AI. Trust breaks and must be rebuilt. Dennis Taylor introduces "schisms in the Bobiverse" specifically to create conflict and prevent staleness. Relationships without conflict flatten. Conflict without resolution frustrates. Give readers both.

### Anti-patterns (Avoid this)

- **Do NOT keep your AI exactly the same across ten books.** The number one reason readers abandon long series: "Character not growing." If book ten's AI is indistinguishable from book one's AI, you've failed to create an arc. Growth doesn't mean transformation—Murderbot is still recognizably Murderbot—but it means evolution.

- **Do NOT resolve the central relationship too early.** If the AI and human reach perfect understanding in book two, you've removed your series' engine. Keep introducing friction, misunderstandings, and challenges to the bond. Comfortable relationships are boring to read about.

- **Do NOT recycle the same arc in every book.** "AI learns to trust humans" is not a series arc—it's a book arc. If your AI learns to trust, then loses trust, then regains trust, then loses it again without meaningful progression, readers will notice the treadmill.

- **Do NOT forget your series arc while writing book arcs.** Each book needs its own complete arc, but the series needs a meta-arc readers can sense. Where is this all going? What is the AI becoming? What's at stake over the long haul? Know the answer even if you don't reveal it.

- **Do NOT add relationship depth only through tragedy.** Not every bonding moment requires someone almost dying. Shared media consumption, banter, small moments of unexpected kindness—these build relationships too. Vary your tools for deepening connection.

---

## Writing style development

The prose style that sells in witty AI buddy space opera is **first-person, conversational, dialog-heavy, and fast**. This is not literary fiction. This is not high prose. This is pulp with heart—readable, voice-driven, and designed for consumption rather than admiration.

Your prose should be invisible. The character's voice should be unmistakable.

### Best practices (Do this)

- **Write in first-person, past tense.** Murderbot, Bobiverse, and Expeditionary Force all use this approach. First-person creates intimacy with the AI consciousness and enables the internal monologue that IS the sub-genre's appeal. Past tense feels natural and allows for the kind of wry retrospective commentary these characters deliver.

- **Make your prose conversational and accessible.** Martha Wells' style is described as "conversational, accessible and wry" with "clear and economical writing" that "creates a brisk pace." Craig Alanson says his style is "heavy on dialog, without a lot of description." You're aiming for compulsive readability, not literary beauty.

- **Let dialog carry the story.** These books are conversation-heavy. The banter between AI and human IS the content. Use minimal description between dialog beats. Keep dialog tags simple ("said" does most of the work) or replace them with action beats. Let characters talking be your primary mode of storytelling.

- **Use short sentences for action, longer sentences for introspection.** Vary your sentence length deliberately. Action scenes: "He ran. The corridor was dark. Footsteps behind him. Closer." Quieter moments allow more complex sentence structures. The rhythm should shift with the emotional content.

- **Deploy humor through internal monologue during external action.** Murderbot's technique: something tense is happening externally while Murderbot's internal commentary provides deadpan humor. "I was having an emotion again" during a crisis. This creates the signature tone of the sub-genre—action and humor happening simultaneously.

- **Write prose clean enough for audiobook performance.** These books succeed dramatically in audio format. R.C. Bray (Expeditionary Force), Ray Porter (Bobiverse), Kevin R. Free (Murderbot)—exceptional narrators can elevate good material, but your prose must work when read aloud. Listen to your sentences. Cut anything that doesn't flow.

### Anti-patterns (Avoid this)

- **Do NOT write literary prose when pulp pace is expected.** Purple prose, extended metaphors, poetic language—these are wrong for this market. Readers want to consume these books quickly. Your job is to be invisible, not beautiful. Save the elegant writing for a different sub-genre.

- **Do NOT neglect sentence rhythm.** Same-length sentences become monotonous. Readers check out even if they can't articulate why. Vary your structures. Mix simple, compound, and complex sentences deliberately.

- **Do NOT let description slow your pace.** These are dialog-heavy, description-light books. When you describe settings, technology, or characters, keep it brief and filtered through your POV character's perspective. What would your AI notice? Describe that. Skip the rest.

- **Do NOT use purple dialogue tags.** "Said sarcastically," "quipped," "snarked," "riposted"—these are amateur moves. If your dialogue is sarcastic, the words should convey it. Trust your reader. Trust your writing. "Said" is sufficient for ninety percent of dialogue.

- **Do NOT break POV for convenience.** You're in your AI's head. Stay there. If your AI can't perceive something, you can't show it directly. This constraint is a feature, not a bug—it creates intimacy and forces you to reveal information cleverly.

## Developmental editing

Developmental editing catches the problems that will kill your book before readers ever see it. These are story-level issues, not sentence-level issues. Structure. Character. Pacing. Logic. The stuff that determines whether your book works at all.

Here's what editors see wrong in this sub-genre—and how to fix it before you need them.

### Best practices (Do this)

- **Check your AI character for psychological depth in every scene.** Your AI should have wants, fears, and internal contradictions visible in their behavior. Surface-level snark without underlying complexity will flatten. Ask yourself: what does my AI want in this scene that they won't say aloud? What are they afraid of? What makes them uncomfortable? If you can't answer, the scene needs work.

- **Verify your plot has genuine stakes, not manufactured ones.** Stakes are artificial if the solution is obvious, if the AI could solve it trivially but you're pretending they can't, or if failure has no real consequences. Genuine stakes feel earned. Your beta readers should feel actual concern about outcomes.

- **Test your pacing by tracking scene types.** Chart your manuscript: action scene, quiet character scene, exposition, banter. Check for patterns. Too many action scenes in a row? Too many quiet scenes? Is the first half of your book AI-light? Flag these issues before an editor does.

- **Ensure each character has a distinct voice and function.** If you could swap dialogue between two supporting characters without anyone noticing, one of them isn't pulling their weight. Every character should speak differently, serve a distinct story function, and justify their existence.

- **Confirm your worldbuilding rules are consistent throughout.** Make a list of your technology's capabilities and limitations. Check your manuscript for violations. This is especially critical for AI characters—their abilities and limitations must remain consistent, or readers will lose trust.

- **Get beta readers from your target audience.** Not your friends. Not your writing group. Readers who actually consume this sub-genre voraciously. Their feedback about pacing, character likability, and humor effectiveness is worth more than any developmental editor's abstract advice.

### Anti-patterns (Avoid this)

- **Do NOT submit manuscripts with sagging middles.** The middle fifty percent of your book is where most failures happen. If your second act feels like "things happen until it's time for the climax," you have structure problems. Your middle should be escalating complications, not wheel-spinning.

- **Do NOT rely on Deus Ex Machina resolutions.** Your AI suddenly developing a new capability, discovering hidden information, or solving the problem through means not previously established—readers will notice, and they will resent it. Every solution must come from elements already in play.

- **Do NOT ignore inconsistencies in AI capability.** If your AI can hack any system in chapter three, they can't fail to hack an obviously simpler system in chapter fifteen without explanation. Keep notes. Check your work. Inconsistent capabilities are the most common AI character mistake.

- **Do NOT submit with unresolved plot threads.** Every significant question you raise should be answered—either in this book or with a clear sense it's a series-level mystery. Abandoned plot threads signal sloppy writing. Editors notice.

- **Do NOT skip professional editing for self-publishing.** The most common criticism of indie books in this sub-genre: "poor editing—grammatical errors, typos." Your book competes against traditionally published work. Professional editing is not optional if you want to succeed.

---

## Dialogue writing

Dialogue is the heartbeat of witty AI buddy space opera. The banter between human and AI is what readers came for. It's also the easiest place to fail—to be annoying instead of charming, repetitive instead of fresh, clever without being real.

The craft of dialogue in this sub-genre is the craft of the sub-genre itself.

### Best practices (Do this)

- **Differentiate AI speech from human speech through content, not mechanics.** Your AI doesn't need to speak in ALL CAPS or use robotic syntax. They need to think differently. Murderbot notices threat percentages and processing loads. Skippy speaks with arrogance and references his superior capabilities. Bob mentions frame-jacking and processing speeds. The AI notices and comments on different things than humans would.

- **Give your AI signature phrases and patterns.** Skippy's "filthy monkeys." Murderbot's "I was having an emotion." These become touchstones readers anticipate and enjoy. Don't overuse them—but establish them early and return to them for effect.

- **Make banter reveal character, not just entertain.** Every exchange of snark should tell you something about who these characters are and how their relationship works. Joe and Skippy's insults show mutual affection under the abuse. Murderbot and ART's squabbling shows grudging respect. If your banter is just joke-joke-joke without character work, it's empty calories.

- **Use subtext.** What characters aren't saying matters as much as what they are. Murderbot deflects emotional conversation by changing subjects. ART expresses care through ship functions rather than words. The reader should understand more than the characters are saying.

- **Read your dialogue aloud.** Every line. If it sounds false spoken, rewrite it. This is non-negotiable. Your dialogue must work audibly because so much of this sub-genre's audience consumes via audiobook.

- **Vary the rhythm of exchanges.** Some banter should be rapid-fire—short lines bouncing back and forth. Some exchanges should have longer speeches. Some dialogue should be interrupted by action beats. Monotonous rhythm kills banter's effectiveness.

### Anti-patterns (Avoid this)

- **Do NOT write dialogue tags like "said sarcastically."** If your dialogue is sarcastic, it should be evident from the words. Adding the tag means you failed at writing the dialogue itself. Trust your readers to hear tone. Use action beats to convey delivery when necessary: "He rolled his eyes" says more than "he said sarcastically."

- **Do NOT have characters use each other's names constantly.** People in real conversation rarely use the name of the person they're talking to. "Well, Joe, I think we should—" "I disagree, Skippy, because—" Nobody talks like that. Cut the names.

- **Do NOT let every character be witty.** If everyone delivers zingers, no one stands out. Your AI should be the primary source of wit. Your human protagonist can have their moments. Supporting characters should mostly react to the wit rather than compete with it.

- **Do NOT exhaust your jokes.** Skippy calling humans "monkeys" works because it's occasional, not constant. If you use your signature jokes every page, they stop being funny. Space out your recurring humor. Let it land fresh each time.

- **Do NOT write banter that's actually bickering.** Banter is good-natured. Even when characters are disagreeing, there should be underlying affection. Genuine hostility without warmth isn't witty AI buddy content—it's a toxic relationship readers won't root for.

- **Do NOT explain the jokes.** If your AI makes a pop culture reference, don't follow it with "referring to the classic TV show—" Kill your explanations. Readers who get the reference will enjoy it. Readers who don't will move on. Explanation murders comedy.

---

## Pacing

Readers of witty AI buddy space opera expect FAST. They expect "page-turner" pacing. They expect "just one more chapter" momentum. They expect to finish your book in one or two sittings because they couldn't stop.

This doesn't mean constant action. It means constant momentum—the sense that every scene earns its place and pushes toward something.

### Best practices (Do this)

- **Keep chapters between 2,500 and 4,000 words.** Short chapters create more "convenient stopping points" that paradoxically keep readers going—they finish one chapter and think "just one more." Thriller pacing uses under 2,500 words; standard sci-fi uses 3,000-4,000. For this sub-genre, err toward shorter.

- **Open chapters with hooks and end them with pull-forward.** Not cliffhangers necessarily—just enough curiosity or momentum to make stopping feel wrong. "I looked at the transmission and realized we had a problem" is better than "The transmission arrived and we analyzed it."

- **Balance action sequences with character moments—but interweave them.** The Murderbot technique: action is happening while internal monologue provides character beats. You don't separate action and character into different scenes. You layer them. Action REVEALS character.

- **Cut scenes that don't serve plot OR character.** Every scene needs to do at least one of these; ideally both. Worldbuilding scenes must also serve plot or character. Pure exposition scenes must be short and earn their place. If a scene is "just nice," cut it.

- **Use the try-fail cycle to maintain momentum.** Hero attempts solution → fails → adapts → tries again → fails differently → finally succeeds. Each cycle can be a scene or a chapter. This structure creates natural momentum and prevents easy success from deflating stakes.

- **Front-load your AI character.** Do not make readers wait half a book for your AI to appear. Columbus Day's biggest criticism is that the first half drags before Skippy arrives. Your AI should be prominent from the earliest possible point.

### Anti-patterns (Avoid this)

- **Do NOT write slow openings.** You have pages, not chapters, to grab readers. Starting with worldbuilding, with backstory, with setup before action—these are death sentences. Start in media res. Start with your protagonist in a situation. Build the world as you go.

- **Do NOT let your middle sag.** Act two is where pacing dies. The problem: you've established the situation, the climax is too far away, and the middle feels like "stuff happens." Your middle needs escalating complications, reversals, revelations, and relationship development. Map it carefully.

- **Do NOT stretch thin material to meet word count.** Murderbot novellas run 30,000-40,000 words. They succeed because Wells doesn't pad. If your story is a novella, don't stretch it to a novel. Readers prefer lean to bloated.

- **Do NOT write action sequences that go on too long.** Extended action becomes numbing. Fight scenes should be tight and purposeful. Space battles should have clear beats and stakes. If your action sequence runs more than one chapter, something should change dramatically at the chapter break.

- **Do NOT sacrifice clarity for speed.** Fast pacing doesn't mean confusing pacing. Readers should always know where characters are, what's happening, and what's at stake. Momentum dies when readers have to re-read paragraphs to understand what occurred.

## Structure

Structure is the skeleton your book hangs on. In witty AI buddy space opera, that skeleton has predictable elements—because readers want predictable elements delivered freshly. Three-act structure isn't a cliché; it's a contract with your reader about how satisfaction is built.

### Best practices (Do this)

- **Use three-act structure proportions: 25% / 50% / 25%.** Act one establishes your characters, situation, and inciting incident—roughly the first quarter. Act two escalates complications through the middle half, hitting a midpoint reversal and a "dark night of the soul." Act three resolves everything in the final quarter. Deviate at your peril.

- **Hit your structural beats clearly.** Inciting incident around 10-15%. First plot point (commitment to journey) at 25%. Midpoint reversal at 50%. Dark moment at 75%. Climax at 85-90%. These aren't arbitrary—they're where readers expect emotional payoffs.

- **Write books of 80,000-150,000 words.** The sweet spot for this sub-genre. Murderbot novellas run shorter (30,000-40,000) but are priced and marketed as novellas. Full novels in this genre often trend longer—Expeditionary Force books exceed 150,000 words—but debut authors should aim for 80,000-100,000.

- **Structure series in satisfying arcs.** Trilogies work. Murderbot's first four novellas function as "season one" with Network Effect as a "season two premiere." Bobiverse's first three books form a complete arc. Even if your series runs longer, think in arcs of 3-5 books that build to major revelations or resolutions.

- **End each book with resolution AND anticipation.** The immediate story problem must be solved—readers need satisfaction. But the series-level questions remain open, and ideally a new complication has appeared that seeds the next book. This is the difference between cliffhanger (frustrating) and hook (compelling).

- **Design your chapter structure to alternate intensity.** High-tension chapter, lower-tension chapter, building chapter, explosive chapter. Readers need breathing room between action peaks. The pattern creates rhythm that's instinctively satisfying.

### Anti-patterns (Avoid this)

- **Do NOT ignore structure because you're a "pantser."** Intuitive writers still need structural awareness, even if they find it in revision rather than outline. Readers have internalized three-act structure whether they know it or not. Books that ignore these expectations feel "off" to readers even when they can't articulate why.

- **Do NOT write cliffhanger endings.** This is not the structure for this audience. Murderbot books resolve their immediate stories. Expeditionary Force books resolve their missions. Readers of this sub-genre expect and deserve complete experiences. Leave threads for sequels—don't leave readers hanging mid-crisis.

- **Do NOT rush your third act.** If your ending feels crammed into too few pages, you've misjudged your structure. The climax needs room to breathe. The resolution needs space for emotional landing. Plan your word count to give act three the space it needs.

- **Do NOT write standalone structure for a series book.** Series books have different structural requirements—seeds planted, callbacks enabled, character growth positioned for future development. If you're writing a series (and in this sub-genre, you should be), structure with future books in mind.

- **Do NOT front-load all your good material.** Some writers put all their best scenes in act one, then struggle to maintain energy. Spread your best moments throughout. Save some of your best material for the back half.

## Sensory details

Space opera lives or dies on immersion. Your readers have never been on a spaceship, fought aliens, or talked to an AI. You must make these experiences feel real through sensory detail—but filtered through your AI protagonist's unique perspective.

### Best practices (Do this)

- **Filter all sensory details through your AI's perception.** What would an AI notice? Murderbot tracks threat vectors, processing loads, ambient data traffic. Bob monitors radiation levels, power consumption, structural integrity. Your AI notices different things than a human would. That difference IS your sensory voice.

- **Use all five senses, not just sight.** The hum of ship systems. The recycled air's metallic taste. The vibration of engines through deck plates. Temperature variations that indicate system problems. Sound especially matters—ships should have soundscapes.

- **Give each location a distinct sensory signature.** Station corridors feel different than ship corridors. Corporate facilities feel different than Preservation's egalitarian spaces. Alien environments should feel alien. The reader should know where they are by sensory details alone.

- **Describe the AI's interface with data.** Feeds updating. Processing loads. The sensation (or lack thereof) of accessing ship systems. The difference between direct data access and limited external observation. This is unique to AI protagonists and creates immersion no human POV can match.

- **Use sensory details to establish mood.** A malfunctioning ship doesn't just look broken—it smells of burnt circuits, it vibrates wrong, its temperature is off, its sounds are alarming. Mood is built through accumulated sensory impressions, not stated emotions.

- **Include mundane sensory details that ground the fantastical.** Murderbot drinks coffee substitute. Ships have maintenance problems. The small, realistic details make the large, fantastic elements believable. Reality anchors imagination.

### Anti-patterns (Avoid this)

- **Do NOT write generic descriptions.** "The spaceship was large and metallic" tells readers nothing. What KIND of metallic? What sounds, what temperatures, what smells? Generic description is worse than no description—it fills space without creating immersion.

- **Do NOT forget your POV character's sensory limitations.** AIs might not experience smell or taste the same way humans do. They might perceive electromagnetic frequencies humans can't. Their descriptions should reflect their actual capabilities. Don't accidentally give your AI human senses they wouldn't have.

- **Do NOT describe things your character wouldn't notice.** If your AI is focused on a tactical threat, they're not appreciating the beauty of the nebula outside. Sensory details should reflect character attention and priorities. Irrelevant details slow pacing without adding immersion.

- **Do NOT pile on description in action scenes.** During a fight, sensory details should be limited to what registers through adrenaline (or whatever your AI's equivalent is). Speed, threat, impact. Save the detailed sensory work for slower moments.

- **Do NOT neglect the AI's "internal space."** Bob builds elaborate VR environments. ART has its own internal experience. Your AI has some form of mental landscape, processing experience, or self-perception. Describe it occasionally to deepen character.

## Action scenes

Space battles. Ground combat. Emergency repairs under fire. Action scenes in witty AI buddy space opera must accomplish multiple goals simultaneously: create excitement, reveal character, advance plot, and maintain the humor-in-tension balance that defines the sub-genre.

This is harder than it looks. It's also essential to your commercial success.

### Best practices (Do this)

- **Keep action scenes tight and purposeful.** Every action scene should have clear stakes, clear objectives, and character revelation. "Exciting things happen" is not sufficient justification. What does this action scene tell us about our characters? What does it change about the situation? Cut any action that doesn't serve these purposes.

- **Use your AI's unique capabilities to create distinctive action.** Murderbot processes multiple data feeds simultaneously, controls drones, and thinks faster than humans. Bob "frame-jacks" to slow or speed subjective time. Skippy hacks systems and provides tactical data. Your AI should fight (or support fighting) in ways only an AI could.

- **Maintain the humor-tension balance during action.** Murderbot's internal commentary during combat ("This would be a bad time to die, I thought. Well, any time would be a bad time to die") provides character voice without deflating stakes. Don't pause action for jokes—weave character voice through the action itself.

- **Ground space battles in character perception, not omniscient description.** First-person POV means your reader knows only what your character perceives. Use this limitation to create tension. "Fog of war"—not knowing what's happening—can make great writing. Don't break POV to show enemy fleet movements your character couldn't know.

- **Make damage matter.** When ships take hits, show the consequences—systems failing, capabilities degrading, options narrowing. "The shields held" is less interesting than "The shields held, barely, and Johnson's station went dark." Meaningful damage creates stakes.

- **End action scenes with changed circumstances.** Something should be different after action than before. Character injured, relationship strained, information gained, resources lost. Action that returns characters to status quo wastes reader investment.

### Anti-patterns (Avoid this)

- **Do NOT let the AI solve action problems too easily.** The "Deus Ex Skippy" trap. If your AI's superior capabilities trivialize combat, you've lost stakes. Give them meaningful limitations that force human creativity. Make them fail sometimes.

- **Do NOT write action scenes longer than necessary.** Readers get numb to extended action. A tightly written two-page fight is more effective than a sprawling ten-page battle. When in doubt, cut.

- **Do NOT forget physics entirely.** You don't need hard SF accuracy, but space has no up and down, ships can't turn like aircraft, and light-speed delay affects communication. Ignoring physics your readers understand breaks immersion. Choose your hand-waves deliberately.

- **Do NOT write "video game" combat.** Two ships shooting at each other until one explodes. Ground combat as shooting gallery. These action scenes lack emotional engagement. Combat should feel dangerous, confusing, consequential—not point-and-click.

- **Do NOT let action overtake character.** Your AI should be thinking, feeling, reacting throughout action—not just executing tactics. Internal monologue during action is essential for this sub-genre. Readers should understand what the action means to the character experiencing it.

## Rhythm

Rhythm is the music of prose. It operates at every level: sentence, scene, chapter, book. Good rhythm is invisible—readers just feel compelled forward. Bad rhythm creates unconscious resistance that slows reading and reduces enjoyment.

For witty AI buddy space opera, rhythm must serve both momentum and humor. These often conflict. Mastering that tension is mastering the sub-genre.

### Best practices (Do this)

- **Vary sentence length constantly and deliberately.** "He entered the room. It was dark and cold and smelled of old machinery, the kind of smell that meant maintenance had been deferred for too long. The screens were dead. No power." Long-short-long-short creates forward motion and prevents monotony.

- **Use rhythm to land humor.** Comedy timing in prose means setup sentences accelerating, then the punchline landing short and direct. "The tactical situation was complex, with multiple threats converging from three vectors, our weapons offline, our shields failing, and the evacuation pods nonresponsive. I was having an emotion again." Long setup, short punchline.

- **Build scene rhythm around emotional arcs.** Start scenes with establishing rhythm (medium sentences, clear information), build through the scene with varied intensity, and end with either a hook (quick, urgent) or an emotional landing (can be slower, weighted). Each scene should feel shaped.

- **Pace chapters like heartbeats—systole and diastole.** High-intensity chapter, lower-intensity chapter. Action followed by reflection. Tension followed by release. The pattern keeps readers engaged without exhausting them.

- **Use paragraph breaks as rhythm tools.** Short paragraphs speed reading. Long paragraphs slow it. Single-sentence paragraphs create emphasis. Vary paragraph length like you vary sentence length.

- **Read your work aloud to test rhythm.** If you stumble, rewrite. If something feels wrong spoken, it reads wrong silently even if readers can't articulate why. Your ear is a better rhythm editor than your eye.

### Anti-patterns (Avoid this)

- **Do NOT write monotonous sentences.** All simple sentences. All complex sentences. All the same length. Readers tune out from rhythmic monotony even when content is good. Vary your structures.

- **Do NOT let humor break tension rhythm inappropriately.** A joke immediately after a character death, a quip during a genuinely traumatic revelation—these are rhythm violations. Humor should provide release after tension, not interrupt tension before it lands.

- **Do NOT front-load all your best rhythm.** Save some energy for the back half. Readers who notice pacing flagging in act two will assume act three will be worse. Maintain rhythmic quality throughout.

- **Do NOT mistake speed for rhythm.** Fast rhythm is not the same as rushed rhythm. Fast can still be controlled, varied, intentional. Rushed feels sloppy, like the author ran out of space. Control your pacing even when it's rapid.

- **Do NOT forget breathing room.** All-action, all-the-time is exhausting. All-banter, all-the-time is cloying. Readers need quiet moments to process and appreciate the intense ones. Build rest into your rhythm.

## Vocabulary and diction

The words you choose determine your reading level, your voice, your audience reach, and your genre credibility. For witty AI buddy space opera, the vocabulary must be accessible enough for broad appeal while science-fictional enough for genre satisfaction.

This is a calibration exercise. Too casual and you lose credibility. Too technical and you lose readers.

### Best practices (Do this)

- **Write at a readable, accessible level—not a dumbed-down level.** These books should feel smart without requiring specialized knowledge. Complex ideas delivered in digestible chunks. Readers praised Murderbot as "one of the most accessible sci-fi series"—this is a compliment, not an insult.

- **Create memorable, intuitive sci-fi terminology.** "SecUnit" is immediately understandable. "Governor module" implies function through language. "Feed" and "drone" use familiar concepts for AI elements. Invent what you need, but make it stick without glossaries.

- **Use military terminology naturally if you're writing military elements.** Ranks, unit structures, operational terminology—these add authenticity when used correctly. But use them as characters would use them, not as the author explaining to readers.

- **Apply human emotional vocabulary awkwardly to AI experience.** This is a humor and character technique. Murderbot's "I was having an emotion" is funny because it's an AI struggling to use human concepts. Your AI should have its own relationship with emotional vocabulary—struggling with it, avoiding it, or deliberately misusing it.

- **Keep sci-fi jargon in service of story, not showing off.** Every technical term should do work—establish setting, create character voice, advance plot. Terms that exist only to sound science-fictional are padding. Cut them or make them serve.

- **Include pop culture vocabulary appropriate to your character.** Murderbot references Sanctuary Moon. Bob uses Star Trek terms. Skippy references human culture he's absorbed. Pop culture vocabulary builds character and creates reader connection—but only if it's organic to who your character is.

### Anti-patterns (Avoid this)

- **Do NOT overload with acronyms.** Too many unfamiliar acronyms make readers feel like they're missing something. Use them sparingly. Expand them naturally in context the first time or avoid them entirely.

- **Do NOT use technobabble as a substitute for actual worldbuilding.** Meaningless technical-sounding words strung together don't create credibility—they expose lack of thought. Better to hand-wave with confidence than techno-babble with complexity.

- **Do NOT write above your genre's reading level.** Literary vocabulary, academic sentence structures, obscure words—these signal wrong genre to readers. Your prose should feel effortless, not challenging.

- **Do NOT inconsistently code your AI's voice.** If your AI uses casual language in chapter one, they shouldn't suddenly become formal in chapter ten without reason. Voice must stay consistent, or character continuity breaks.

- **Do NOT use vocabulary you don't understand.** Technical terms you've researched but don't truly understand will ring false to readers who do. When in doubt, simplify or explain.

## Final words from Rex

Listen. This manual is comprehensive. It's detailed. It's prescriptive.

It's also not magic.

Writing commercial fiction is a craft. Craft is learned through practice. Dennis Taylor talks about "the million words rule"—you need to write about a million words before you really know what you're doing. Martha Wells published for twenty years before Murderbot made her a star.

Read the successful books in this sub-genre. Study them. Reverse-engineer why they work. Then write. Write your AI character until their voice flows without effort. Write your plots until pacing becomes instinct. Write dialogue until banter emerges naturally.

This sub-genre rewards voice above all. The authors who succeed have voices so distinctive readers would recognize them from a single page. That voice doesn't come from following rules—it comes from writing enough that your unique perspective crystallizes.

The rules in this manual will keep you from obvious failures. They'll help you understand what readers expect. They'll prevent you from reinventing wheels that don't need reinventing.

But the thing that will make you succeed? The thing that will make readers pre-order your sequels, recommend your books to friends, and follow you through twenty novels?

That's your voice. Your specific AI character. Your unique take on the human-AI relationship.

Find it. Develop it. Trust it.

Then deliver exactly what your readers crave.

That's the job. Now get to work.
